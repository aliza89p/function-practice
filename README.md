##Sum Function  
Think of two numerical values to enter in function.  
Enter sum(numOne, numTwo); in console.  
-This function takes two numerical parameters.
-I then created a variable called sumTotal which adds the two parameters.
-Finally the function enters a message in the console stating the two numerical values and their sum.
