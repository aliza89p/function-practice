##Sum Function  
Think of two numerical values to enter in function. Use these as numOne and numTwo.
Enter sum(numOne, numTwo); in console.  
-This function takes two numerical parameters.
-I then created a variable called sumTotal which adds the two parameters.
-Finally the function enters a message in the console stating the two numerical values and their sum.  
##Multiply Function  
Think of two numerical values to enter in function. Use these as numOne and numTwo.
Enter multiply(numOne, numTwo); in console.  
-This function takes two numerical parameters.
-I then created a variable called multiplyProduct which multiplies the two parameters.
-Finally the function enters a message in the console stating the two numerical values and their product.  
##Sum and Multiply Function
Think of three numerical values to enter in function. Use these as numOne, numTwo, and numThree.
Enter sumAndMultiply(numOne, numTwo, numThree); in console.  
-This function takes three numerical parameters and shows you the result of them all multiplied together and added together.
-Commented out console.log();
-Needed to return previous functions to call them in this function.
-This function will return the sum and the product in an array and console.log what happened.
##SumArray Function
Run this function with an array of numerical elements.
-This function will run a for loop to run through the numbers in the array and add them together.
-This will then console log the array numbers and the their sum.
